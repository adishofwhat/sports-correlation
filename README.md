# sports-correlation
We read in a file of metropolitan regions and associated sports teams from the dataset and answer some questions about each metropolitan region. Each of these regions may have one or more teams from the "Big 4": NFL, MLB, NBA or NHL. 

For each sport we calculate the win/loss ratio's correlation with the population of the city it is in.
